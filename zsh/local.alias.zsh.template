# What need to be paid attention to is all the $, \, ` in single quote mark will not be processed
# specially, they will be treated as normal characters. This rule is common both in csh, bash, zsh.
# So we should prefer double quote mark in shell script. In addition, in zsh alias can't support to
# process arguments, so aliases that need arguments only can be implemented as zsh function.

# Reliable Connection
# 1. mosh
# alias rd-server="mosh xx.xxx.xx.xx"
#
# 2. autossh + tmux
# In order to ensure this method work, below requirements must be satisfied.
# - Client machine must have installed `autossh`.
# - If `tmux` can't be found in `${PATH}` of server machine, then the `tmux` path of server machine
#   must be specified.
# - Runtime configuration files of server machine's default shell which will be sourced when the
#   shell is launched as none login shell must clear and can be executed successfully.
# - Mustn't use any environment variable in `tmux` path, only `~` can be used as far as I know,
#   because environment variables will be expanded on client machine side.
# Debug Tips:
# If below command not work, try to only run `autossh -M 0 xx.xxx.xx.xx` to check whether the
# runtime configuration file of server machine's default shell is clear or not.
#
# autossh_tmux() {
#   autossh -M 0 $1 -t "~/.dotfiles/bin/tmux new -A -s `date +%m-%d-%H-%M-%S`"
# }
#
# alias rd-server="autossh_tmux xx.xxx.xx.xx"
